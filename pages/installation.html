==> How to install LiteGapps <==
1.Magisk Module Only [MAGISK]

-install rom
-install magisk
-reboot
-install litegapps
-reboot

2.Recovery Only [RECOVERY]
You can install this version via magisk manager and recovery like twrp, but this will not be installed as a magisk module
-wipe
-install rom
-install litegapps
-reboot

3.Magisk Module/non magisk [AUTO]
•If you want to install it as a magisk module
-Wipe
-Install rom
-install magisk
-install Litegapps
-reboot

•if you want to install it without magisk
-Wipe
-install rom
-install Litegapps
-install magisk (if you want to install magisk)
-reboot

##########################

You can also uninstall litegapps even without magisk, the way you have to reinstall litegapps.zip (it will automatically become an uninstaller)

Notes :
1. version [Magisk Only] or version [AUTO] which is converted as magisk module does not make litegapps work fully. works about 85%
2. Litegapps supports uninstaller, maybe google applications like youtube, google chrome and force close, because these applications need gapps.
