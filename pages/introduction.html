What is LiteGapps?  Litegapps is a package of google applications such as Playstore, Google Play service and so on.  Litegapps is made as light and minimal as possible, and with the help of Magisk it becomes systemless

• Booster

• Download Package litegapps
• battery saver
• Gms Dose
• And many others

The beginnings of Litegapps
Litegapps is inspired by my habit of always being simple, for years I was looking for the lightest Gapps and I found them but it's not as light as I thought.  actually I don't like GoogleApps because it only takes up RAM, battery and makes your cellphone slow. I only need gapps to sync contacts and download games after that I don't need gapps anymore, so I made this Litegapps!  With Litegapps you can uninstall all Gapps if you don't need them from your phone and your life!  Because this is systemless.

The difference between litegapps and other gapps
